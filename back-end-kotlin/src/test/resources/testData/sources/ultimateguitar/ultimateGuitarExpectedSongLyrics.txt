[Verse 1]

G/B C     G   Am
I   close my eyes
G           Dm7            Am             G/B
only for a moment, and the moment's gone.
C   G/B Am
All my  dreams
G              Dm7         Am
pass before my eyes, a curiosity.


[Chorus]

D/F#   G       Am     Am/G
   Dust in the wind.
D/F#            G           Am
All they are is dust in the wind.


[Verse 2]

G/B C    G/B Am
    Same old song.
G               Dm7        Am           G/B
Just a drop of water in an endless sea.
C   G/B Am
All we  do
G               Dm7                Am
crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.


[Chorus]

D/F#   G       Am     Am/G
   Dust in the wind.
D/F#          G           Am     G/A
All we are is dust in the wind.
F/A
Oh

[Verse 3]

C     G/B  Am
Don't hang on.
G                 Dm7         Am
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.
G/B C     G/B Am
It  slips a - way.
G              Dm7           Am
All your money won't another minute buy.


[Chorus]

D/F#  G           Am     Am/G
      Dust in the wind.
D/F#          G            Am                Am/G
All we are is dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind
D/F#       G         Am                  Am/G         D/F#
      Dust   in the wind.  Everything is dust in the wind
               G           Am
Everything is dust in the wind.
