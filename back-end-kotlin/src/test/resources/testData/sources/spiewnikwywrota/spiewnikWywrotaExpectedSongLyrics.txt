|@G|Twenty Five years and my life is still
|@Am|Trying to get up that great big hill of |@C|hope
For a desti|@G|nation
|@G|I realized quickly when I knew that I should
That the w|@Am|orld was made of this brotherhood of |@C|man
For whatever that |@G|means


|@G|And So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to |@Am|get it all out
whats in my head and I,|@C| I am feeling a little pe|@G|culiar.
|@G|So I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I |@Am|take a deep breath and I get real high and
I |@C|Scream at the top of my lungs WHATS GOIN O|@G|N?


[Refren]
|@G|And I said Heyeyeyeyey
|@Am|Heyeyey
I said |@C|Hey Whats going |@G|on?
|@G|And I said Heyeyeyeyey

And I |@G|try, oh my god do I |@Am|try
I try all the |@C|time, in this insti|@G|tution
And I |@G|pray, oh my god do I |@Am|pray
I pray every single |@C|day
For a revo|@G|lution


|@G|And So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to |@Am|get it all out
whats in my head and I,|@C| I am feeling a little pe|@G|culiar.
|@G|So I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I |@Am|take a deep breath and I get real high and
I |@C|Scream at the top of my lungs WHATS GOIN O|@G|N?
